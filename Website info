Well I chose to the restaurant concept, a burger restaurant to specific.

This is image inspired my idea. My idea is to have the menu items display
all over the page. The name of the burgers restaurant is floating burger, so
the idea is to make the menu items all over the page. The menu items will be
images which the user can interact with. if the user decides to pick a item, it
will be added to the bag.

I still have to find a way to display the additional info associated with te
burgers.
